# Mow the land

## Week 2 Assignment 3_2 - NECC
## Professor Ethel Schuster
## Student Patricia Antlitz

### This program takes user input using built-in function scanf from the stdio library.  -

##### User interactions:

- It asks the user to enter the width and the length of the land in feet.
- It asks for the length and the width of a property in the land, if any, in feet.
- It asks for the width of the mower blade in inches.

##### Set values:

- The program assumes an speed of 2.0 per square feet
- The program assumes an average efficiency of 80% for the mower.

##### Calculation:

This program calculates the time it would take to mow a rectangular or square plot of land
It takes into consideration the length and the width of the land as the area
it subtracts the area of the lan's house or building, if any
it takes into consideration the average efficiency of mows at 80%, a speed of 2.0 sqf per second and the size of the mow's blade
in inches.
The program calculates how many second it would take to mow and then display the seconds as
hours, minutes, secs and as seconds only as well.

I researched the best formulas for this but did not encounter any problems to implement them into C.
